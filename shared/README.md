## ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Automation

Justice Dashboard is fully automated for Railway deployment. To build, bundle, and deploy live:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the frontend
- Copy the build to the backend public folder
- Deploy the backend to Railway
- Bind ports automatically

### Environment Variables (set in Railway dashboard):
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `ADMIN_USERNAME=<secure>`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure>`
- `JWT_SECRET=<generated>`
- `SESSION_SECRET=<generated>`

After deploy, your app will be live at:
```
https://<your-project>.up.railway.app
```
