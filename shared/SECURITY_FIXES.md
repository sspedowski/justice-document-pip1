# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79/80
**Files Fixed:**
- `backend.server.js`
- `script.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `escapeHtml()` helper function to sanitize user input
- All user-controllable data is now escaped before DOM insertion
- Prevents malicious script injection through user names and form data

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials - CWE-798/259
**Files Fixed:**
- `admin-users.js`

**Changes:**
- Replaced hardcoded passwords with environment variables:
  - `process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  - `process.env.STEPHANIE_PASSWORD` 
  - `process.env.LEGAL_PASSWORD`
- Removed password logging from console output
- Credentials now sourced from secure environment variables

### 3. Code Injection - CWE-94
**Files Fixed:**
- `justice-dashboard/src/JusticeDashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added proper function validation before execution
- Removed unsafe dynamic code execution patterns
- Added error handling for animation callbacks

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file or Railway environment:

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
STEPHANIE_PASSWORD=your_secure_stephanie_password  
LEGAL_PASSWORD=your_secure_legal_password
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests
2. **Authorization Middleware**: Add proper auth checks to all protected routes
3. **Input Validation**: Add server-side validation for all user inputs
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS
5. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
6. **Session Security**: Use secure, httpOnly cookies for session management

## Testing Security Fixes

1. Test XSS prevention by entering `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in user fields
2. Verify credentials are loaded from environment variables
3. Check that no sensitive data appears in console logs
4. Validate that user input is properly escaped in DOM

## Deployment Notes

- Update Railway environment variables before deploying
- Test authentication with new environment-based credentials
- Monitor logs for any security-related errors
