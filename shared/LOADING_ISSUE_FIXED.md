# ✅ DASHBOARD LOADING ISSUE FIXED!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified and Resolved**

### **❌ The Issue**

The Justice Dashboard wasn't loading because of a **server routing configuration problem**:

```javascript
// BROKEN - Frontend routes were commented out
// app.get("*", (req, res) => {
//   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "client", "index.html"));
// });
```

### **✅ The Solution**

Fixed the server routing to properly serve the `index.html` file:

```javascript
// FIXED - Proper frontend routing
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  // For API routes, let them handle their own responses
  if (req.path.startsWith("/api/")) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "API endpoint not found" });
  }

  // Serve the main dashboard for all other routes
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "index.html"));
});
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Server Configuration Issue**

- The Express.js server had the frontend routing **disabled/commented out**
- This meant the server wasn't serving the `index.html` file for main routes
- Browser requests to `http://localhost:3000` weren't getting the HTML content
- API endpoints were working, but the dashboard interface wasn't accessible

### **Why It Happened**

- Previous development may have disabled frontend serving for testing
- The server was configured for API-only mode
- Static file serving was enabled, but route handling was broken
