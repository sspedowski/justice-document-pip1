const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',

## 📦 How to Handle `build/` and `dist/` Output Folders (DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP)

1. **Always keep both `build/` and `dist/` folders in your `.gitignore` file.**
   ```
   build/
   dist/
   ```

2. **DO NOT manually edit, open, or change any files inside `build/` or `dist/`.**
   - These files are automatically generated by your build tools.

3. **When doing a full clean-up or before a fresh build, delete all contents INSIDE the `build/` and `dist/` folders.**
   ```
   rm -rf build/* dist/*
   ```
   - Do NOT delete the folders themselves if your build system needs them—just empty them.

4. **After cleaning, run your build process as usual.**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Never track or commit any files inside `build/` or `dist/` to your git repository.**
   - Only your source code should be tracked in git.

6. **Summary:**
   - `build/` and `dist/` are NOT source code—never edit them by hand.
   - Keep them OUT of git at all times.
   - Only source code and config files go in your repo.

**DO NOT SKIP OR ALTER ANY STEP.
This ensures a clean, maintainable project for everyone!**

## 🚧 Status & Legacy TODOs

- Admin registration and persistent database storage are NOT yet implemented. User credentials are file-based and for demo/dev only.
- All authentication and secure case management logic is now in server.js (project root).
- The backend/server.js file is for legacy reference only.
- The file users.json is no longer tracked for security—see .gitignore.
- Automated tests are not yet implemented. See `package.json` for test status.

**God’s path to justice continues—thank you for joining the mission.**
