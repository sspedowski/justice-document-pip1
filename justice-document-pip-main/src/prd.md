**Primary User Activity**: Acting and Creating - Users upload documents, classify evidence, and generate reports for legal proceedings

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, professionalism, and systematic organization - appropriate for legal and justice contexts.

**Design Personality**: Professional, serious, and reliable with clean lines and clear information hierarchy.

**Visual Metaphors**: Justice scales, legal documents, organized file systems, and government/institutional aesthetics.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, organized interface that prioritizes function over decoration while maintaining professional polish.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional monochromatic with accent colors for status indication

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - conveying trust, stability, and authority
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue backgrounds for cards and sections
**Accent Color**: Warm gold (oklch(0.65 0.15 50)) - for important actions and highlights
**Status Colors**: 
- Red for Primary/critical documents
- Blue for Supporting documents  
- Green for External documents
- Gray for excluded documents

**Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust and conveys seriousness appropriate for legal contexts. Gold accents suggest importance and quality without being flashy.
