This PR locks in reliable, fast, and readable linting.

What's included
- Workflow triggers: path filters + manual workflow_dispatch
- Concurrency: cancel in-progress runs per branch
- Speed: ESLint cache via actions/cache (.eslintcache)
- Annotations: problem matcher + Unix formatter (-f unix)
- Flat-config alignment: uses eslint --no-ignore targeting frontend/src

Why
- Fewer noisy CI runs (only when JS/TS or lint config changes)
- Faster repeated runs with caching
- Inline PR annotations for quick fixes
- Consistent flat-config behavior locally and in CI

How to verify
- Actions  Lint should start on this PR (or trigger manually)
- Push a commit with an intentional lint error to see annotations
